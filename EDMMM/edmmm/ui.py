"""
Renders EDMMM's panel in EDMC's main window as a set of pages you scroll
between with the ◂ / ▸ nav: two detailed kill-stacking pages (Massacre
Space, Settlement Raids Ground), a handful of general pages covering every
other mission type, and one non-mission page (Community Goals) tacked onto
the same nav - see _PAGE_ORDER/_PAGE_LABELS below.
Mission pages are
separate rather than merged because kill-stacking math doesn't generalize
to missions that have no kill count - see edmmm/mission_types.py for how a
mission lands on a given page.

Visual design notes:
- Text widgets are plain tk and inherit EDMC's configured theme colors by
  default, for accessibility and custom dark-theme text colors. A widget
  that sets its own `fg` at creation - before theme.update() ever sees it -
  keeps that color permanently instead: EDMC's theme system only ever
  auto-colors a widget's foreground if it didn't already have one at first
  registration (see the nav arrows' ACCENT color below).
- Kill progress is drawn as small Canvas bars; the drawn rectangles fully
  cover the canvas, so theming the canvas background is irrelevant.
- EDMC's panel is narrow and its width isn't under this plugin's control, so
  entries are laid out as stacked "cards" (a couple of short lines each)
  rather than a wide multi-column table: a fixed-column grid can't wrap, so
  on a narrow panel it either overflows or squashes unreadably. Each line is
  a small pack()-managed frame with left-anchored content on one side and
  right-anchored content on the other (see _line()) - unlike grid columns,
  the left side can wrap onto extra lines without disturbing the right side.
